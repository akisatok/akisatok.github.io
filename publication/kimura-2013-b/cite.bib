 abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method of discovering a set of image contents sharing a specific context (attributes or implicit meaning) with the help of image collections obtained from social curation platforms. Socially curated contents are promising to analyze various kinds of multimedia information, since they are manually filtered and organized based on specific individual preferences, interests or perspectives. Our proposed method fully exploits the process of social curation: (1) How image contents are manually grouped together by users, and (2) how image contents are distributed in the platform. Our method reveals the fact that image contents with a specific context are naturally grouped together and every image content includes really various contexts that cannot necessarily be verbalized by texts.
