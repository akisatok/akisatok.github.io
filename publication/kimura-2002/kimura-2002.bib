 abstract = {We propose a quick algorithm for multimedia signal search. The algorithm comprises two techniques: feature compression based on piecewise linear maps and distance bounding to efficiently limit the search space. When compared with existing multimedia search techniques, they greatly reduce the computational cost required in searching. Although feature compression is employed in our method, our bounding technique mathematically guarantees the same recall rate as the search based on the original features; no segment to be detected is missed. Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm is approximately 10 times faster than and as accurate as an existing fast method maitaining the same search accuracy.},
