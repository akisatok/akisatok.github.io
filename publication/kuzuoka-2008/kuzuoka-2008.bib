 abstract = {This paper deals with a universal lossy coding problem for a certain kind of multiterminal source coding network called a complementary delivery system. A universal coding scheme based on Wyner-Ziv codes is proposed. While the proposed scheme cannot attain the optimal rate-distortion trade off in general, the rate-loss is upper bounded by a universal constant under some mild conditions. Moreover, the proposed scheme allows us to apply (non-universal) Wyner-Ziv codes to construct a universal lossy complementary delivery code.},
