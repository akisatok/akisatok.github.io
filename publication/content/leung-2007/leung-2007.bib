 abstract = {This report proposes a new algorithm for extracting salient regions of videos by introducing two important properties of the early human visual system: (1) Instantaneous saliency depletion with gradual recovery, whereby saliency is instantaneously suppressed and gradually recovered in previously attended regions. (2) Gradual saliency depletion with instantaneous recovery, whereby saliency is gradually decreased over time in non-surprising regions and at the same time recovered in surprising locations. With the introduction of these properties, redundant information in videos can be suppressed and important information is eventually enhanced.},
