 abstract = {In this paper, we propose the use of local distance-based features determined by Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Traditionally, DTW is used as a robust distance metric for time series patterns. However, this traditional use of DTW only utilizes the scalar distance metric and discards the local distances between the dynamically matched sequence elements. This paper proposes recovering these local distances, or DTW features, and utilizing them for the input of a CNN. We demonstrate that these features can provide additional information for the classification of isolated handwritten digits and characters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DTW features can be combined with the spatial coordinate features in multi-modal fusion networks to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the Unipen online handwritten character datasets.},
