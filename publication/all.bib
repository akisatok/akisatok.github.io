Is it possible to implement this noteworthy human ability on machines? In this paper, we study a new task that consists of predicting image recognition results in the form of semantic segmentation with given multichannel audio signals. Our approach uses a convolutional neural network that is designed to directly output semantic segmentation results by taking audio features as its inputs. A bilinear feature fusion scheme is incorporated that efficiently models underlying higher-order interactions between audio and visual sources. Experimental evaluations with both synthetic and real sound datasets show that our approach can recover the desired segmented images reasonably well.},

abstract = {We propose a neural network-based framework for learning local representations of multivariate time series, and demonstrate its effectiveness for online signature verification. In contrast to related works that optimize a global distance objective, we incorporate a Siamese network into dynamic time warping (DTW), leading to a novel prewarping Siamese network (PSN) optimized with a local embedding loss. PSN learns a feature space that preserves the temporal location-wise distances of local structures. Local embedding, along with the alignment conditions of DTW, imposes a temporal consistency constraint on the sequence-level distance measure while achieving invariance as regards non-linear distortions. Validation on online signature verification datasets demonstrates the advantage of our framework over existing techniques that use either handcrafted or learned feature representations.},

Our approach inherits the idea of knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge from a deep or wide reference model to a shallow or narrow target model. The proposed method employs this idea to mimic predictions of reference estimators that are more robust against overfitting than the network we want to train. Different from almost all the previous work for knowledge distillation that requires a large amount of labeled training data, the proposed method requires only a small amount of training data. Instead, we introduce pseudo training examples that are optimized as a part of model parameters. Experimental results for several benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperformed all the other baselines, such as naive training of the target model and standard knowledge distillation.},

Traditionally, DTW is used as a robust distance metric for time series patterns. However, this traditional use of DTW only utilizes the scalar distance metric and discards the local distances between the dynamically matched sequence elements. This paper proposes recovering these local distances, or DTW features, and utilizing them for the input of a CNN. We demonstrate that these features can provide additional information for the classification of isolated handwritten digits and characters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the DTW features can be combined with the spatial coordinate features in multi-modal fusion networks to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on the Unipen online handwritten character datasets.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel type of random forests called a denoising random forests that are robust against noises contained in test samples. Such noise-corrupted samples cause serious damage to the estimation performances of random forests, since unexpected child nodes are often selected and the leaf nodes that the input sample reaches are sometimes far from those for a clean sample. Our main idea for tackling this problem originates from a binary indicator vector that encodes a traversal path of a sample in the forest. Our proposed method effectively employs this vector by introducing denoising autoencoders into random forests. A denoising autoencoder can be trained with indicator vectors produced from clean and noisy input samples, and non-leaf nodes where incorrect decisions are made can be identified by comparing the input and output of the trained denoising autoencoder. Multiple traversal paths with respect to the nodes with incorrect decisions caused by the noises can then be considered for the estimation.},

abstract = {Supernovae Type-Ia (SNeIa) play a significant role in exploring the history of the expansion of the Universe, since they are the best-known standard candles with which we can accurately measure the distance to the objects. Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.},

Hence, incorporating auditory information into a human visual attention model would be a key issue for building more sophisticated models. However, the way of integrating multiple pieces of information arising from audio-visual domains still remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel computational model of human visual attention driven by auditory cues. Founded on the Bayesian surprise model that is considered to be promising in the literature, our model uses surprising auditory events to serve as a clue for selecting synchronized visual features and then emphasizes the selected features to form the final surprise map. Our approach to audio-visual integration focuses on using effective visual features alone but not all available features for simulating visual attention with the help of auditory information. Experiments using several video clips show that our proposed model can better simulate eye movements of human subjects than other existing models in spite that our model uses a smaller number of visual features.},

However, the growth of social media and smart devices led to a considerable change in this traditional relationship between news providers and consumers. Hundreds of thousands of news articles are now distributed on social media, and consumers can access those articles at any time via smart devices. This has meant that news providers are under pressure to find ways of engaging the attention of consumers. This paper provides a novel solution to this problem by identifying attractive headlines as a gateway to news articles.

Using our investigation as a basis, we also propose a learning-to-rank method that suggests promising news headlines. Our experiments with 2,000 news articles demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately identify attractive news headlines from the candidates and reveals several promising factors of making news articles go viral.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel method for training random forests with big data on MapReduce clusters. Random forests are well suited for parallel distributed systems, since they are composed of multiple decision trees and every decision tree can be independently trained by ensemble learning methods. However, naive implementation of random forests on distributed systems easily overfits the training data, yielding poor classification performances. This is because each cluster node can have access to only a small fraction of the training data. The proposed method tackles this problem by introducing the following three steps. (1) "Shared forests" are built in advance on the master node and shared with all the cluster nodes. (2) With the help of transfer learning, the shared forests are adapted to the training data placed on each cluster node. (3) The adapted forests on every cluster node are returned to the master node, and irrelevant trees yielding poor classification performances are removed to form the final forests. Experimental results show that our proposed method for MapReduce clusters can quickly learn random forests without any sacrifice of classification performance.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel stochastic process that represents the arbitrary rectangular partitioning of an infinite-dimensional matrix as the conditional projective limit. Rectangular partitioning is used in relational data analysis, and is classified into three types: regular grid, hierarchical, and arbitrary. Conventionally, a variety of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data analysis. In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic model of arbitrary partitioning called the rectangular tiling process (RTP). Our model has a sound mathematical base in projective systems and infinite extension of conditional probabilities, and is capable of representing partitions of infinite elements as found in ordinary Bayesian nonparametric models.},

abstract = {The major interest of the current social network service (SNS) developers and users are rapidly shifting from conventional text-based (micro)blogs such as Twitter and Facebook to multimedia contents such as Flickr, Snapchat, MySpace and Tumblr. However, the ability to analyze and exploit unorganized multimedia contents on those services still remain inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing and machine learning techniques. This paper focuses on another emerging trend called social curation, a human-in-the-loop alternative to automatic algorithms for social media analysis. Social curation can be defined as a spontaneous human process of remixing social media content for the purpose of further consumption. What characterize social curation are definitely the manual efforts involved in organizing a collection of social media contents, which indicates that socially curated content has a potential as a promising information source against automatic summaries generated by algorithms. Curated contents would also provide latent perspectives and contexts that are not explicitly presented in the original resources. Following this trend, this paper presents recent developments and growth of social curation services, and reviews several research trials for cross-media analysis and mining from socially curated contents. {\textcopyright} 2014 National Institute of Informatics.},

abstract = {Social media such as microblogs have become so pervasive such that it is now possible to use them as sensors for real-world events and memes. While much recent research has focused on developing automatic methods for filtering and summarizing these data streams, we explore a different trend called social curation. In contrast to automatic methods, social curation is characterized as a human-in-the-loop and sometimes crowd-sourced mechanism for exploiting social media as sensors. Although social curation web services like Togetter, Naver Matome and Storify are gaining popularity, little academic research has studied the phenomenon. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the phenomenon and potential of this new field of social curation. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of curated microblog data. We seek to understand why and how people participate in this laborious curation process. We then explore new ways in which information retrieval and machine learning technologies can be used to assist curators. In particular, we propose a novel method based on a learning-to-rank framework that increases the curator's productivity and breadth of perspective by suggesting which novel microblogs should be added to the curated content.

abstract = {Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) is a traditional unsupervised machine learning technique for decomposing a matrix into a set of bases and coefficients under the non-negative constraint. NMF with sparse constraints is also known for extracting reasonable components from noisy data. However, NMF tends to give undesired results in the case of highly sparse data, because the information included in the data is insufficient to decompose. Our key idea is that we can ease this problem if complementary data are available that we could integrate into the estimation of the bases and coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization method called Non-negative Multiple Matrix Factorization (NMMF), which utilizes complementary data as auxiliary matrices that share the row or column indices of the target matrix. The data sparse- ness is improved by decomposing the target and auxiliary matrices simultaneously, since auxiliary matrices provide information about the bases and coefficients. We formulate NMMF as a generalization of NMF, and then present a parameter estimation procedure derived from the multiplicative up- date rule. We examined NMMF in both synthetic and real data experiments. The effect of the auxiliary matrices appeared in the improved NMMF performance. We also confirmed that the bases that NMMF obtained from the real data were intuitive and reasonable thanks to the non-negative constraint.},

Auxiliary data tensors compensate for the sparseness of the target data tensor. The factors of the auxiliary tensors also allow us to examine the target data from several different aspects. We experimentally confirm that NMTF performs better than NTF in terms of reconstructing the given data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed NMTF can successfully extract spatio-temporal patterns of people's daily life such as leisure, drinking, and shopping activity by analyzing several tensors extracted from online review data sets. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Change-point detection is the problem of finding abrupt changes in time-series, and it is attracting a lot of attention in the artificial intelligence and data mining communities. In this paper, we present a supervised learning based change-point detection approach in which we use the separability of past and future data at time t (they are labeled as +1 and -1) as plausibility of change-points. Based on this framework, we propose a detection measure called the additive Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (aHSIC), which is defined as the weighted sum of the HSIC scores between features and its corresponding binary labels. Here, the HSIC is a kernelbased independence measure. A novel aspect of the aHSIC score is that it can incorporate feature selection during its detection measure estimation. More specifically, we first select features that are responsible for an abrupt change by using a supervised approach, and then compute the aHSIC score by employing the selected features. Thus, compared with traditional detection measures, our approach tends to be robust as regards noise features, and so the aHSIC is suitable for a use with high-dimensional time-series change-point detection problems. We demonstrate that the proposed change-point detection method is promising through extensive experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world human activity data set.},

abstract = {The amount and variety of multimedia data such as images, movies and music available on over social networks are increasing rapidly. However, the ability to analyze and exploit these unorganized multimedia data remains inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing techniques. Our finding in this paper is that the emerging social curation service is a promising information source for the automatic understanding and mining of images distributed and exchanged via social media. One remarkable virtue of social curation service datasets is that they are weakly supervised: the content in the service is manually collected, selected and maintained by users. This is very different from other social information sources, and we can utilize this characteristics for media content mining without expensive media processing techniques. In this paper we present a machine learning system for predicting view counts of images in social curation data as the first step to automatic image content evaluation. Our experiments confirm that the simple features extracted from a social curation corpus are much superior in terms of count prediction than the goldstandard image features of computer vision research. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

For example, suppose that we have an image containing an object and a background with a similar color or tex- ture to the object. The proposed framework enables us to automatically extract the object from the image while eliminating the misleading background. Although our segmenta- tion framework takes a form of a traditional formulation based on Markov random fields, the proposed method provides a novel scheme to integrate depth and color information, which derives objectness/backgroundness likelihood. We also employ depth estimation via supervised learning so that the proposed method can work even if it has only a single input image with no actual depth information. Experimental results with a dataset origi- nally collected for the evaluation demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method against the baseline method and several existing methods for salient region detection.},

However, FLDA implicitly assumes that all the classes share the same covariance: which implies that FLDA might fail when this assumption is not necessarily satisfied. To overcome this problem, we propose a simple extension of FLDA that exploits a detailed covariance structure of every class by utilizing revealed by the class-wise auto-correlation matrices. The proposed method achieves remarkable improvements classification accuracy against FLDA while preserving two major strengths of FLDA: the ease of use and low computational costs.

However, CCA tends to perform poorly when the number of paired samples is limited, which is often the case in practice. To cope with this problem, we propose a semi-supervised variant of CCA named "Semi CCA" that allows us to incorporate additional unpaired samples for mitigating overfitting. The proposed method smoothly bridges the eigenvalue problems of CCA and principal component analysis (PCA), and thus its solution can be computed efficiently just by solving a single (generalized) eigenvalue problem as the original CCA. Preliminary experiments with artificially generated samples and PASCAL VOC data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The method involves feature-dimension reduction based on a piecewise linear representation of a sequential feature trajectory extracted from a long audio stream. Two techniques enable us to obtain a piecewise linear representation: the dynamic segmentation of feature trajectories and the segment-based Karhunen-Loeve (KL) transform. The proposed search method guarantees the same search results as the search method without the proposed feature-dimension reduction method in principle. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in search speed. For example, the proposed method reduced the total search time to approximately 1/12 that of previous methods and detected queries in approximately 0.3 s from a 200-h audio database. {\textcopyright} 2008 IEEE.},

TAS is a method of searching through long audio or video recordings for a specified segment, based on signal similarity. TAS is fast; it can search through a 24-hour recording in 1 second after a query-independent preprocessing. However, an even faster method is required when we consider a huge amount of audio archives, for example a month's worth of recordings. Thus, we propose a preprocessing method that significantly accelerates TAS. The core part of this method comprises a global histogram clustering of long signals and a pruning scheme using those clusters. Tests using broadcast recording indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a search speed approximately 3 to 30 times faster than TAS. In these tests, the search results are exactly the same as with TAS.},
