 abstract = {We have developed a small cylindrical display for anthropomorphic agents that communicate with multiple users in a 3D environment. A previously reported cylindrical display was dark with poor contrast in the lower part of the screen because the pixel density is much lower than in the upper part. We improved the uniformity of the pixel density by using an aspherical mirror. Experimental results show that our new display has better luminance and better contrast than the previously reported display.},
