      <description>&lt;p&gt;We are excited to announce that our paper &amp;ldquo;Baxter permutation process&amp;rdquo; has been accepted to NeurIPS2020 as a spotlight presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this paper, a Bayesian nonparametric model for Baxter permutations (BPs), termed BP process (BPP) is proposed and applied to relational data analysis. The BPs are a well-studied class of permutations, and it has been demonstrated that there is one-to-one correspondence between BPs and several interesting objects including floorplan partitioning, which constitutes a subset of rectangular partitioning. Accordingly, the BPP can be used as a floorplan partitioning model. We combine the BPP with a multi-dimensional extension of the stick-breaking process called the block-breaking process to fill the gap between floorplan partitioning and rectangular partitioning, and obtain a stochastic process on arbitrary rectangular partitionings. Compared with conventional Bayesian nonparametric models for arbitrary rectangular partitionings, the proposed model is simpler and has a high affinity with Bayesian inference.&lt;/p&gt;
