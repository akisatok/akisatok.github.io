The survey was performed for the 1.77 deg$^2$ ultra-deep layer and 5.78 deg$^2$ deep layer in the Subaru Strategic Program over 6- and 4-month periods from 2016 to 2017, respectively. The ultra-deep layer shows a median depth per epoch of 26.4, 26.3, 26.0, 25.6, and 24.6 mag in $g$, $r$, $i$, $z$, and $y$ bands, respectively; the deep layer is $backslashsim0.6$ mag shallower. In total, 1,824 supernova candidates were identified. Based on light curve fitting and derived light curve shape parameter, we classified 433 objects as Type Ia supernovae (SNe); among these candidates, 129 objects have spectroscopic or COSMOS2015 photometric redshifts and 58 objects are located at $z textgreater 1$. Our unique dataset doubles the number of Type Ia SNe at $z textgreater 1$ and enables various time-domain analyses of Type II SNe, high redshift superluminous SNe, variable stars, and active galactic nuclei.","tags":null,"title":"The Hyper Suprime-Cam SSP transient survey in COSMOS: Overview","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaomeng Wu","Akisato Kimura","Seiichi Uchida","Kunio Kashino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"95a3d04d5d679b151225c6355a573941","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/8683036/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.805637Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/8683036/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a neural network-based framework for learning local representations of multivariate time series, and demonstrate its effectiveness for online signature verification.

Different from almost all the previous work for knowledge distillation that requires a large amount of labeled training data, the proposed method requires only a small amount of training data. Instead, we introduce pseudo training examples that are optimized as a part of model parameters.

Such noise-corrupted samples cause serious damage to the estimation performances of random forests, since unexpected child nodes are often selected and the leaf nodes that the input sample reaches are sometimes far from those for a clean sample. Our main idea for tackling this problem originates from a binary indicator vector that encodes a traversal path of a sample in the forest. Our proposed method effectively employs this vector by introducing denoising autoencoders into random forests. A denoising autoencoder can be trained with indicator vectors produced from clean and noisy input samples, and non-leaf nodes where incorrect decisions are made can be identified by comparing the input and output of the trained denoising autoencoder. Multiple traversal paths with respect to the nodes with incorrect decisions caused by the noises can then be considered for the estimation.","tags":null,"title":"Denoising random forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["篤志 中澤","俊彦 山崎","康之 松下","満 安倍","卓哉 舩冨","昭悟 木村","誠一 内田","英作 前田"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"f525b1010205f7a2c1be2c13112e16ac","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2017/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.845112Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2017/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"PRMU 応用研究におけるオープンアイデア: PRMU 第二期グランドチャレンジ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Ichiro Takahashi","Masaomi Tanaka","Naoki Yasuda","Naonori Ueda","Naoki Yoshida"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"90fd13c5e4f8415bb8840f017ac36664","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/kimura-2017/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.846134Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/kimura-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Supernovae Type-Ia (SNeIa) play a significant role in exploring the history of the expansion of the Universe, since they are the best-known standard candles with which we can accurately measure the distance to the objects. Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.","tags":["Supernova","convolutional neural network","deep learning","image classification","redshift"],"title":"Single-Epoch Supernova Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["昭悟 木村"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"fcf8a40122755a1f60c5871d33ec42de","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2017-a/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.860812Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2017-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"画像メディアとSNS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Katsuhiko Ishiguro","Issei Sato","Masahito Nakano","Akisato Kimura","Naonori Ueda"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"9dd9ec9f21a8815dd18bcdf0dd309f85","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/ishiguro-2016/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.863414Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/ishiguro-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a probabilistic model for non-exhaustive and overlapping (NEO) bi-clustering.

Random forests are well suited for parallel distributed systems, since they are composed of multiple decision trees and every decision tree can be independently trained by ensemble learning methods. However, naive implementation of random forests on distributed systems easily overfits the training data, yielding poor classification performances. This is because each cluster node can have access to only a small fraction of the training data. The proposed method tackles this problem by introducing the following three steps. (1) \"Shared forests\" are built in advance on the master node and shared with all the cluster nodes. (2) With the help of transfer learning, the shared forests are adapted to the training data placed on each cluster node. (3) The adapted forests on every cluster node are returned to the master node, and irrelevant trees yielding poor classification performances are removed to form the final forests. Experimental results show that our proposed method for MapReduce clusters can quickly learn random forests without any sacrifice of classification performance.","tags":["Decision trees","Distributed forests","MapReduce","ensemble learning methods"],"title":"Distributed forests for MapReduce-based machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Fujiki","Masaru Tanaka","Hitoshi Sakano","Akisato Kimura"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1430438400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430438400,"objectID":"05ab633f58076adba03620a47d0d6bbb","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/fujiki-2015/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.901624Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/fujiki-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper provides a geometrical aspect of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis (FLDA), which has been widely used owing to its simple formulation and low computational costs.

However, the growth of social media and smart devices led to a considerable change in this traditional relationship between news providers and consumers. Hundreds of thousands of news articles are now distributed on social media, and consumers can access those articles at any time via smart devices. This has meant that news providers are under pressure to find ways of engaging the attention of consumers. This paper provides a novel solution to this problem by identifying attractive headlines as a gateway to news articles. We first perform one of the first investigations of news headlines on a major viral medium. Using our investigation as a basis, we also propose a learning-to-rank method that suggests promising news headlines. Our experiments with 2,000 news articles demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately identify attractive news headlines from the candidates and reveals several promising factors of making news articles go viral.","tags":["Learning to rank","News headlines","Social media","Virality"],"title":"Identifying attractive news headlines for social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiro Nakajima","Akisato Kimura","Akihiro Sugimoto","Kunio Kashino"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"7ccc17b6501603034cf7eec15949e9e6","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/nakajima-2015/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.899529Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/nakajima-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Human visual attention can be modulated not only by visual stimuli but also by ones from other modalities such as audition. Hence, incorporating auditory information into a human visual attention model would be a key issue for building more sophisticated models. However, the way of integrating multiple pieces of information arising from audio-visual domains still remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel computational model of human visual attention driven by auditory cues. Founded on the Bayesian surprise model that is considered to be promising in the literature, our model uses surprising auditory events to serve as a clue for selecting synchronized visual features and then emphasizes the selected features to form the final surprise map. Our approach to audio-visual integration focuses on using effective visual features alone but not all available features for simulating visual attention with the help of auditory information. Experiments using several video clips show that our proposed model can better simulate eye movements of human subjects than other existing models in spite that our model uses a smaller number of visual features.","tags":["Auditory cues","Bayesian surprise","Feature selection","Synchronization","Visual attention"],"title":"Visual Attention Driven by Auditory

media such as microblogs have become so pervasive such that it is now possible to use them as sensors for real-world events and memes. While much recent research has focused on developing automatic methods for filtering and summarizing these data streams, we explore a different trend called social curation. In contrast to automatic methods, social curation is characterized as a human-in-the-loop and sometimes crowd-sourced mechanism for exploiting social media as sensors. Although social curation web services like Togetter, Naver Matome and Storify are gaining popularity, little academic research has studied the phenomenon. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the phenomenon and potential of this new field of social curation. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of curated microblog data. We seek to understand why and how people participate in this laborious curation process. We then explore new ways in which information retrieval and machine learning technologies can be used to assist curators. In particular, we propose a novel method based on a learning-to-rank framework that increases the curator's productivity and breadth of perspective by suggesting which novel microblogs should be added to the curated content.

However, the ability to analyze and exploit unorganized multimedia contents on those services still remain inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing and machine learning techniques. This paper focuses on another emerging trend called social curation, a human-in-the-loop alternative to automatic algorithms for social media analysis. Social curation can be defined as a spontaneous human process of remixing social media content for the purpose of further consumption. What characterize social curation are definitely the manual efforts involved in organizing a collection of social media contents, which indicates that socially curated content has a potential as a promising information source against automatic summaries generated by algorithms. Curated contents would also provide latent perspectives and contexts that are not explicitly presented in the original resources.

Rectangular partitioning is used in relational data analysis, and is classified into three types: regular grid, hierarchical, and arbitrary. Conventionally, a variety of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data analysis.

In this paper, we present a supervised learning based change-point detection approach in which we use the separability of past and future data at time t (they are labeled as +1 and -1) as plausibility of change-points. Based on this framework, we propose a detection measure called the additive Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (aHSIC), which is defined as the weighted sum of the HSIC scores between features and its corresponding binary labels. Here, the HSIC is a kernelbased independence measure. A novel aspect of the aHSIC score is that it can incorporate feature selection during its detection measure estimation. More specifically, we first select features that are responsible for an abrupt change by using a supervised approach, and then compute the aHSIC score by employing the selected features. Thus, compared with traditional detection measures, our approach tends to be robust as regards noise features, and so the aHSIC is suitable for a use with high-dimensional time-series change-point detection problems. We demonstrate that the proposed change-point detection method is promising through extensive experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world human activity data set.","tags":["Change-Point Detection","Feature Selection","High-dimensional Data"],"title":"Change-point detection with feature selection in high-dimensional time-series data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Marcos Alvarez","Makoto Yamada","Akisato Kimura","Tomoharu Iwata"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"ae0bd59d58a6cc865ca3012e7146bd1b","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/marcos-alvarez-2013/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.01071Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/marcos-alvarez-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a simple yet effective anomaly detection method for multi-view data.

NMF with sparse constraints is also known for extracting reasonable components from noisy data. However, NMF tends to give undesired results in the case of highly sparse data, because the information included in the data is insufficient to decompose. Our key idea is that we can ease this problem if complementary data are available that we could integrate into the estimation of the bases and coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization method called Non-negative Multiple Matrix Factorization (NMMF), which utilizes complementary data as auxiliary matrices that share the row or column indices of the target matrix. The data sparse- ness is improved by decomposing the target and auxiliary matrices simultaneously, since auxiliary matrices provide information about the bases and coefficients. We formulate NMMF as a generalization of NMF, and then present a parameter estimation procedure derived from the multiplicative up- date rule. We examined NMMF in both synthetic and real data experiments. The effect of the auxiliary matrices appeared in the improved NMMF performance. We also confirmed that the bases that NMMF obtained from the real data were intuitive and reasonable thanks to the non-negative constraint.","tags":["Non-negative Matrix Factorization","Social Curration"],"title":"Non-negative multiple matrix factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["香織 片岡","昭悟 木村","和彦 村崎","恭子 数藤","行信 谷口"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"238556f3536112dd7ae2782e74a4d576","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2013-a/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.001268Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SNS を利用したトピックモデルによる画像へのユーザ嗜好陛の解析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Masashi Sugiyama","Takuho Nakano","Hirokazu Kameoka","Hitoshi Sakano","Eisaku Maeda","Katsuhiko Ishiguro"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"b7f3edf2a2ac3b0a6201d648b835c405","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/kimura-2013/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:13.994154Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/kimura-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a powerful tool for analyzing multi-dimensional paired data.

For example, suppose that we have an image containing an object and a background with a similar color or tex- ture to the object. The proposed framework enables us to automatically extract the object from the image while eliminating the misleading background. Although our segmenta- tion framework takes a form of a traditional formulation based on Markov random fields, the proposed method provides a novel scheme to integrate depth and color information, which derives objectness/backgroundness likelihood. We also employ depth estimation via supervised learning so that the proposed method can work even if it has only a single input image with no actual depth information.

However, the ability to analyze and exploit these unorganized multimedia data remains inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing techniques. Our finding in this paper is that the emerging social curation service is a promising information source for the automatic understanding and mining of images distributed and exchanged via social media. One remarkable virtue of social curation service datasets is that they are weakly supervised: the content in the service is manually collected, selected and maintained by users. This is very different from other social information sources, and we can utilize this characteristics for media content mining without expensive media processing techniques. In this paper we present a machine learning system for predicting view counts of images in social curation data as the first step to automatic image content evaluation. Our experiments confirm that the simple features extracted from a social curation corpus are much superior in terms of count prediction than the goldstandard image features of computer vision research. © 2012 IEEE.","tags":["Automatic image understanding and evaluation","Feature extraction","Regression","Social curation"],"title":"Towards automatic image understanding and mining via social curation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["昭悟 木村","竜 米谷","高嗣 平山"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"33afcaea49f5074a93970b2a16f6fdbc","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2012-a/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.030692Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2012-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"[サーベイ発表] 人間の視覚的注意の計算モデル","type":"publication"},{"authors":["竜 米谷","昭悟 木村","鋭 坂野","賢 福地"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"f029ee987783ec2ba1840529db5ad184","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2012-b/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.051068Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2012-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"深度画像推定を用いた自動物体セグメンテーション","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jun Takagi","Yasunori Ohishi","Akisato Kimura","Masashi Sugiyama","Makoto Yamada","Hirokazu Kameoka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"4827a33be58aa664d3e00e96d0759c4a","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/takagi-2011/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.095261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/takagi-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel semi-supervised method for building a statistical model that represents the relationship between sounds and text labels (“tags”).

The main technique in the method is dynamic segmentation that partitions sequential feature trajectories dynamically. While dynamic segmentation reduces the average dimensionality and accelerates the search, it requires huge amount of calculation. Thus, our method quickly executes suboptimal partitioning of the trajectories by using the discreteness of dimension changes. This guarantees the optimal amount of calculation to derive the suboptimal partitioning under the condition that the dimension monotonously increases as the segment length increases. The experiment shows that our method is over 10 times faster than a straightforward dynamic segmentation method.","tags":null,"title":"Dynamic-segmentation-based feature dimension reduction for quick audio/video searching","type":"publication"},{"authors":["昭悟 木村","邦夫 柏野","隆行 黒住","洋 村瀬"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1041379200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1041379200,"objectID":"1023efa3c5f2f1e493f5df640be303b6","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/2003/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.317674Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/2003/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"グローバルな枝刈りを導入した音や映像の高速探索","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Kunio Kashino","Takayuki Kurozumi","Hiroshi Murase"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1020211200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1020211200,"objectID":"8ef6d18f51b6be02a03056feadc091d8","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/kimura-2002/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.32452Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/kimura-2002/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a quick algorithm for multimedia signal search.

TAS is a method of searching through long audio or video recordings for a specified segment, based on signal similarity. TAS is fast; it can search through a 24-hour recording in 1 second after a query-independent preprocessing. However, an even faster method is required when we consider a huge amount of audio archives, for example a month's worth of recordings. Thus, we propose a preprocessing method that significantly accelerates TAS. The core part of this method comprises a global histogram clustering of long signals and a pruning scheme using those clusters. Tests using broadcast recording indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves a search speed approximately 3 to 30 times faster than TAS. In these tests, the search results are exactly the same as with TAS.","tags":null,"title":"Very quick audio searching: introducing global pruning to the Time-Series Active Search","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Tomohiko Uyematsu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":978307200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":978307200,"objectID":"d2032436aba4ddafa47a1b33b6b2f979","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/content/kimura-2001-a/","publishdate":"2019-08-15T13:59:14.332619Z","relpermalink":"/publication/content/kimura-2001-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Slepian and Wolf first considered the data compression of correlated sources called the SW system, where two sequences emitted from correlated sources are separately encoded to codewords, and sent to a single decoder which has to output original sequence pairs.
