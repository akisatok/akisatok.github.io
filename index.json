The Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) transient survey, conducted from fall 2016 through spring 2017, yielded 1824 SN candidates. This gave rise to the need for fast type classification for spectroscopic follow-up and prompted us to develop a machine learning algorithm using a deep neural network (DNN) with highway layers. This machine is trained by actual observed cadence and filter combinations such that we can directly input the observed data array into the machine without any interpretation. We tested our model with a dataset from the LSST classification challenge (Deep Drilling Field). Our classifier scores an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.996 for binary classification (SN Ia or non-SN Ia) and 95.3% accuracy for three-class classification (SN Ia, SN Ibc, or SN II). Application of our binary classification to HSC transient data yields an AUC score of 0.925. With two weeks of HSC data since the first detection, this classifier achieves 78.1% accuracy for binary classification, and the accuracy increases to 84.2% with the full dataset.

Different from almost all the previous work for knowledge distillation that requires a large amount of labeled training data, the proposed method requires only a small amount of training data.

This paper proposes recovering these local distances, or DTW features, and utilizing them for the input of a CNN. We demonstrate that these features can provide additional information for the classification of isolated handwritten digits and characters.

Such noise-corrupted samples cause serious damage to the estimation performances of random forests, since unexpected child nodes are often selected and the leaf nodes that the input sample reaches are sometimes far from those for a clean sample. Our main idea for tackling this problem originates from a binary indicator vector that encodes a traversal path of a sample in the forest. Our proposed method effectively employs this vector by introducing denoising autoencoders into random forests. A denoising autoencoder can be trained with indicator vectors produced from clean and noisy input samples, and non-leaf nodes where incorrect decisions are made can be identified by comparing the input and output of the trained denoising autoencoder. Multiple traversal paths with respect to the nodes with incorrect decisions caused by the noises can then be considered for the estimation.","tags":[],"title":"Denoising random forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mitsuru Ambai","Takuya Funatomi","Akisato Kimura","Atsushi Nakazawa","Toshihiko Yamazaki","Yasusuki Matsushita","Seiichi Uchida","Eisaku Maeda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275354,"objectID":"04f375d0d7185d5d46005bf3e7723b93","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/prmugc-2017-fundamental/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:31.068574Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prmugc-2017-fundamental/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PRMU 基礎研究におけるオープンアイデア: PRMU 第二期グランドチャレンジ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Atsushi Nakazawa","Toshihiko Yamazaki","Yasusuki Matsushita","Mitsuru Ambai","Takuya Funatomi","Akisato Kimura","Seiichi Uchida","Eisaku Maeda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275355,"objectID":"8b4cfc9a503a6f3029cfec9b28cb8cad","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/prmugc-2017-practical/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:31.83885Z","relpermalink":"/publication/prmugc-2017-practical/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"PRMU 応用研究におけるオープンアイデア: PRMU 第二期グランドチャレンジ","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Ichiro Takahashi","Masaomi Tanaka","Naoki Yasuda","Naonori Ueda","Naoki Yoshida"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275355,"objectID":"c7ebaf8d15ae8329401aaa3f01c58504","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/kimura-2017/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:32.318352Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kimura-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"Supernovae Type-Ia (SNeIa) play a significant role in exploring the history of the expansion of the Universe, since they are the best-known standard candles with which we can accurately measure the distance to the objects. Finding large samples of SNeIa and investigating their detailed characteristics have become an important issue in cosmology and astronomy. Existing methods relied on a photometric approach that first measures the luminance of supernova candidates precisely and then fits the results to a parametric function of temporal changes in luminance. However, it inevitably requires multi-epoch observations and complex luminance measurements. In this work, we present a novel method for classifying SNeIa simply from single-epoch observation images without any complex measurements, by effectively integrating the state-of-the-art computer vision methodology into the standard photometric approach. Our method first builds a convolutional neural network for estimating the luminance of supernovae from telescope images, and then constructs another neural network for the classification, where the estimated luminance and observation dates are used as features for classification. Both of the neural networks are integrated into a single deep neural network to classify SNeIa directly from observation images. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed method and reveal classification performance comparable to existing photometric methods with multi-epoch observations.","tags":["\"Supernova\"","\"convolutional neural network\"","\"deep learning\"","\"image classification\"","\"redshift\""],"title":"Single-Epoch Supernova Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275356,"objectID":"07e0ae2cec7227352c516267c4a1ccb5","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/2017-a/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:33.103267Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"画像メディアとSNS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1477958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275766,"objectID":"40d6d51de05db0243450e0146981b7e2","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/u-tokyo-global-2016/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:56:54.93506Z","relpermalink":"/talk/u-tokyo-global-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[Invited] 膨大なメディアデータの認識・探索と活用","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599368339,"objectID":"343536c6359efb2d35156f4de24c8f80","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/tsukuba-kakenhi-201609/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:56:56.42898Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tsukuba-kakenhi-201609/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[Invited] 多変量解析の一般化とそのメディア認識への応用","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Ryuei Murata","Akisato Kimura","Yoshitaka Ushiku","Takayoshi Yamashita","Yuji Yamauchi","Hironobu Fujiyoshi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1470009600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599368339,"objectID":"84a03442137099079d0632a928c52383","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/miru-2016/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:56:57.514041Z","relpermalink":"/talk/miru-2016/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Efficient online parallel training of random forests based on Mondrian forests","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Katsuhiko Ishiguro","Issei Sato","Masahito Nakano","Akisato Kimura","Naonori Ueda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275356,"objectID":"10f3d2e6f542cb1d569982569e384555","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/ishiguro-2016/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:33.46545Z","relpermalink":"/publication/ishiguro-2016/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a probabilistic model for non-exhaustive and overlapping (NEO) bi-clustering.

Random forests are well suited for parallel distributed systems, since they are composed of multiple decision trees and every decision tree can be independently trained by ensemble learning methods.

This is because each cluster node can have access to only a small fraction of the training data. The proposed method tackles this problem by introducing the following three steps. (1) \\\"Shared forests\\\" are built in advance on the master node and shared with all the cluster nodes. (2) With the help of transfer learning, the shared forests are adapted to the training data placed on each cluster node. (3) The adapted forests on every cluster node are returned to the master node, and irrelevant trees yielding poor classification performances are removed to form the final forests.

We show that the geometry of two class FLDA can be described via communication theory of noisy channel.","tags":[],"title":"Geometric interpretation of Fisher's linear discriminant analysis through communication theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1425168000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599368343,"objectID":"4d7ce054df1daa50ba44c59b9ac41e2c","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/tohoku-lsi-2015/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:02.582911Z","relpermalink":"/talk/tohoku-lsi-2015/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[Invited] Computation models of human visual attention driven by auditory cues","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Sawa Kourogi","Akisato Kimura","Hitoshi Nishikawa","Hiroyuki Fujishiro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275360,"objectID":"06742d9fd6380d91a62689447b937bcb","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/kourogi-2015/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:37.943241Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kourogi-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"In the past, leading newspaper companies and broadcasters were the sole distributors of news articles, and thus news consumers simply received news articles from those outlets at regular intervals. However, the growth of social media and smart devices led to a considerable change in this traditional relationship between news providers and consumers. Hundreds of thousands of news articles are now distributed on social media, and consumers can access those articles at any time via smart devices. This has meant that news providers are under pressure to find ways of engaging the attention of consumers. This paper provides a novel solution to this problem by identifying attractive headlines as a gateway to news articles. We first perform one of the first investigations of news headlines on a major viral medium. Using our investigation as a basis, we also propose a learning-to-rank method that suggests promising news headlines. Our experiments with 2,000 news articles demonstrate that our proposed method can accurately identify attractive news headlines from the candidates and reveals several promising factors of making news articles go viral.","tags":["\"Learning to rank\"","\"News headlines\"","\"Social media\"","\"Virality\""],"title":"Identifying attractive news headlines for social media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jiro Nakajima","Akisato Kimura","Akihiro Sugimoto","Kunio Kashino"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275358,"objectID":"ef606c4a226766706bde2926a5c31894","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/nakajima-2015/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:36.196035Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakajima-2015/","section":"publication","summary":"Human visual attention can be modulated not only by visual stimuli but also by ones from other modalities such as audition. Hence, incorporating auditory information into a human visual attention model would be a key issue for building more sophisticated models. However, the way of integrating multiple pieces of information arising from audio-visual domains still remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel computational model of human visual attention driven by auditory cues. Founded on the Bayesian surprise model that is considered to be promising in the literature, our model uses surprising auditory events to serve as a clue for selecting synchronized visual features and then emphasizes the selected features to form the final surprise map. Our approach to audio-visual integration focuses on using effective visual features alone but not all available features for simulating visual attention with the help of auditory information. Experiments using several video clips show that our proposed model can better simulate eye movements of human subjects than other existing models in spite that our model uses a smaller number of visual features.","tags":["\"Auditory cues\"","\"Bayesian surprise\"","\"Feature selection\"","\"Synchronization\"","\"Visual attention\""],"title":"Visual Attention Driven by Auditory

media such as microblogs have become so pervasive such that it is now possible to use them as sensors for real-world events and memes. While much recent research has focused on developing automatic methods for filtering and summarizing these data streams, we explore a different trend called social curation. In contrast to automatic methods, social curation is characterized as a human-in-the-loop and sometimes crowd-sourced mechanism for exploiting social media as sensors. Although social curation web services like Togetter, Naver Matome and Storify are gaining popularity, little academic research has studied the phenomenon. In this paper, our goal is to investigate the phenomenon and potential of this new field of social curation. First, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of curated microblog data. We seek to understand why and how people participate in this laborious curation process. We then explore new ways in which information retrieval and machine learning technologies can be used to assist curators. In particular, we propose a novel method based on a learning-to-rank framework that increases the curator's productivity and breadth of perspective by suggesting which novel microblogs should be added to the curated content.

However, the ability to analyze and exploit unorganized multimedia contents on those services still remain inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing and machine learning techniques. This paper focuses on another emerging trend called social curation, a human-in-the-loop alternative to automatic algorithms for social media analysis. Social curation can be defined as a spontaneous human process of remixing social media content for the purpose of further consumption. What characterize social curation are definitely the manual efforts involved in organizing a collection of social media contents, which indicates that socially curated content has a potential as a promising information source against automatic summaries generated by algorithms. Curated contents would also provide latent perspectives and contexts that are not explicitly presented in the original resources. Following this trend, this paper presents recent developments and growth of social curation services, and reviews several research trials for cross-media analysis and mining from socially curated contents. © 2014 National Institute of Informatics.","tags":["\"Content curation\"","\"Cross-media analysis\"","\"Cross-media mining\"","\"Human computation\"","\"Social media\""],"title":"Large-scale cross-media analysis and mining from socially curated contents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Masahito Nakano","Katsuhiko Ishiguro","Akisato Kimura","Takeshi Yamada","Naonori Ueda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275361,"objectID":"e4bc1347e291cc542da855b066627324","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/nakano-2014/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:39.741188Z","relpermalink":"/publication/nakano-2014/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a novel stochastic process that represents the arbitrary rectangular partitioning of an infinite-dimensional matrix as the conditional projective limit. Rectangular partitioning is used in relational data analysis, and is classified into three types: regular grid, hierarchical, and arbitrary. Conventionally, a variety of probabilistic models have been advanced for the first two, including the product of Chinese restaurant processes and the Mondrian process. However, existing models for arbitrary partitioning are too complicated to permit the analysis of the statistical behaviors of models, which places very severe capability limits on relational data analysis.

In this paper, we propose Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization (NMTF), which factorizes the target tensor and auxiliary tensors simultaneously. Auxiliary data tensors compensate for the sparseness of the target data tensor. The factors of the auxiliary tensors also allow us to examine the target data from several different aspects. We experimentally confirm that NMTF performs better than NTF in terms of reconstructing the given data. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the proposed NMTF can successfully extract spatio-temporal patterns of people's daily life such as leisure, drinking, and shopping activity by analyzing several tensors extracted from online review data sets. © 2013 IEEE.","tags":["\"Machine Learning\"","\"Non-negative Tensor Factorization\"","\"Spatio-Temporal Pattern\""],"title":"Non-negative Multiple Tensor Factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Marcos Alvarez","Makoto Yamada","Akisato Kimura","Tomoharu Iwawa"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599369569,"objectID":"48fc03212fa3caee1f7c1c272922aee0","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/ibis-2013-alejandro/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:10.845985Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ibis-2013-alejandro/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Multi-view anomaly detection based on clustering inconsistency","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1383264000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599371781,"objectID":"4a9e6c47df5a0d34113a3ac5cecd0ec8","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/template/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:08.898145Z","relpermalink":"/talk/template/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[Invited] Are you ready? -

In this paper, we present a supervised learning based change-point detection approach in which we use the separability of past and future data at time t (they are labeled as +1 and -1) as plausibility of change-points. Based on this framework, we propose a detection measure called the additive Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (aHSIC), which is defined as the weighted sum of the HSIC scores between features and its corresponding binary labels. Here, the HSIC is a kernelbased independence measure. A novel aspect of the aHSIC score is that it can incorporate feature selection during its detection measure estimation. More specifically, we first select features that are responsible for an abrupt change by using a supervised approach, and then compute the aHSIC score by employing the selected features. Thus, compared with traditional detection measures, our approach tends to be robust as regards noise features, and so the aHSIC is suitable for a use with high-dimensional time-series change-point detection problems. We demonstrate that the proposed change-point detection method is promising through extensive experiments on synthetic data sets and a real-world human activity data set.","tags":["\"Change-Point Detection\"","\"Feature Selection\"","\"High-dimensional Data\""],"title":"Change-point detection with feature selection in high-dimensional time-series data","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alejandro Marcos Alvarez","Makoto Yamada","Akisato Kimura","Tomoharu Iwata"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275369,"objectID":"95d508c65628d52671a25201f1898605","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/marcos-alvarez-2013/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:48.107899Z","relpermalink":"/publication/marcos-alvarez-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper proposes a simple yet effective anomaly detection method for multi-view data.

However, NMF tends to give undesired results in the case of highly sparse data, because the information included in the data is insufficient to decompose. Our key idea is that we can ease this problem if complementary data are available that we could integrate into the estimation of the bases and coefficients. In this paper, we propose a novel matrix factorization method called Non-negative Multiple Matrix Factorization (NMMF), which utilizes complementary data as auxiliary matrices that share the row or column indices of the target matrix. The data sparse- ness is improved by decomposing the target and auxiliary matrices simultaneously, since auxiliary matrices provide information about the bases and coefficients. We formulate NMMF as a generalization of NMF, and then present a parameter estimation procedure derived from the multiplicative up- date rule. We examined NMMF in both synthetic and real data experiments. The effect of the auxiliary matrices appeared in the improved NMMF performance. We also confirmed that the bases that NMMF obtained from the real data were intuitive and reasonable thanks to the non-negative constraint.","tags":["\"Non-negative Matrix Factorization\"","\"Social Curration\""],"title":"Non-negative multiple matrix factorization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kaori Kataoka","Akisato Kimura","Kazuhiko Murasaki","Kyoko Sudo","Yukinobu Taniguchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275368,"objectID":"200e30d1f323875cf927ed0b439b4c84","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/2013-a/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:47.253858Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2013-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"SNS を利用したトピックモデルによる画像へのユーザ嗜好陛の解析","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Masashi Sugiyama","Takuho Nakano","Hirokazu Kameoka","Hitoshi Sakano","Eisaku Maeda","Katsuhiko Ishiguro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275368,"objectID":"b23405f84ce1319164d1004fead41ca4","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/kimura-2013/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:46.646028Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kimura-2013/","section":"publication","summary":"Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is a powerful tool for analyzing multi-dimensional paired data.

To overcome this problem, we propose a simple extension of FLDA that exploits a detailed covariance structure of every class by utilizing revealed by the class-wise auto-correlation matrices. The proposed method achieves remarkable improvements classification accuracy against FLDA while preserving two major strengths of FLDA: the ease of use and low computational costs.

Although our segmenta- tion framework takes a form of a traditional formulation based on Markov random fields, the proposed method provides a novel scheme to integrate depth and color information, which derives objectness/backgroundness likelihood. We also employ depth estimation via supervised learning so that the proposed method can work even if it has only a single input image with no actual depth information.

However, the ability to analyze and exploit these unorganized multimedia data remains inadequate, even with state-of-the-art media processing techniques. Our finding in this paper is that the emerging social curation service is a promising information source for the automatic understanding and mining of images distributed and exchanged via social media. One remarkable virtue of social curation service datasets is that they are weakly supervised: the content in the service is manually collected, selected and maintained by users. This is very different from other social information sources, and we can utilize this characteristics for media content mining without expensive media processing techniques. In this paper we present a machine learning system for predicting view counts of images in social curation data as the first step to automatic image content evaluation. Our experiments confirm that the simple features extracted from a social curation corpus are much superior in terms of count prediction than the goldstandard image features of computer vision research. © 2012 IEEE.","tags":["\"Automatic image understanding and evaluation\"","\"Feature extraction\"","\"Regression\"","\"Social curation\""],"title":"Towards automatic image understanding and mining via social curation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura","Ryo Yonetani","Takatsugu Hirayama"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275373,"objectID":"67e1bebdc17f3d154ef87541395ad23a","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/2012-a/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:52.244244Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-a/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[サーベイ発表] 人間の視覚的注意の計算モデル","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ryo Yonetani","Akisato Kimura","Hitoshi Sakano","Ken Fukuchi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275374,"objectID":"f503200241275d528ac9a2cae0056e65","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/2012-b/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:54.215369Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2012-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"深度画像推定を用いた自動物体セグメンテーション","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yongqing Sun","Go Irie","Takashi Sato","Akira Kojima","Kyoko Sudo","Masashi Morimoto","Akisato Kimura","Zhihua Zhang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1322697600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599371633,"objectID":"7f14a949502c85bdfb585a68b1c91aaa","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/trecvid-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:19.156535Z","relpermalink":"/talk/trecvid-2011/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Semantic Indexing task","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Hiroshi Kajino","Akisato Kimura","Katsuhiko Ishiguro"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1320105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599371634,"objectID":"f72a3fa76a4e664c439086dd58d91e98","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/ibis-2011-kajino/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:19.855812Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ibis-2011-kajino/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"マルチモーダル相関を考慮したトピックモデルに基づく映像アノテーション","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Tsukasa Ohashi","Akisato Kimura","Hitoshi Sakano","Hiroshi Sawada"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1320105600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599371635,"objectID":"45bb31d18dc2f2790331376bacc446a6","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/ibis-2011-ohashi/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:20.34648Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ibis-2011-ohashi/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"仮想クラス生成に基づく正準相関分析への特徴追加","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Akisato Kimura"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1317427200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599371841,"objectID":"b3bea220fe4c3b8c9913c7178f2d225a","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/talk/ritsumei-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-06T05:57:20.982858Z","relpermalink":"/talk/ritsumei-2011/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"[Invited] 映像認識/理解のための認知発達的アプローチ","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Jun Takagi","Yasunori Ohishi","Akisato Kimura","Masashi Sugiyama","Makoto Yamada","Hirokazu Kameoka"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599275377,"objectID":"d4265d73576da0debcbaad73105368cc","permalink":"https://akisatok.github.io/publication/takagi-2011/","publishdate":"2020-09-05T03:14:57.639659Z","relpermalink":"/publication/takagi-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a novel semi-supervised method for building a statistical model that represents the relationship between sounds and text labels (“tags”).

However, an even faster method is required when we consider a huge amount of audio archives, for example a month's worth of recordings. Thus, we propose a preprocessing method that significantly accelerates TAS. The core part of this method comprises a global histogram clustering of long signals and a pruning scheme using those clusters.
