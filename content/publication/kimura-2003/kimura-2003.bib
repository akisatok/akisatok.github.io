 abstract = {We propose a new feature dimension reduction method for multimedia search. The main technique in the method is dynamic segmentation that partitions sequential feature trajectories dynamically. While dynamic segmentation reduces the average dimensionality and accelerates the search, it requires huge amount of calculation. Thus, our method quickly executes suboptimal partitioning of the trajectories by using the discreteness of dimension changes. This guarantees the optimal amount of calculation to derive the suboptimal partitioning under the condition that the dimension monotonously increases as the segment length increases. The experiment shows that our method is over 10 times faster than a straightforward dynamic segmentation method.},
