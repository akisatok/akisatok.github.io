 abstract = {This paper deals with a universal coding problem for a certain kind of multiterminal source coding network called a generalized complementary delivery network. In this network, messages from multiple correlated sources are jointly encoded, and each decoder has access to some of the messages to enable it to reproduce the other messages. Both fixed-to-fixed length and fixed-to-variable length lossless coding schemes are considered. Explicit constructions of universal codes and the bounds of the error probabilities are clarified by using methods of types and graph-theoretical analysis. Â© 2009 IEEE.},
