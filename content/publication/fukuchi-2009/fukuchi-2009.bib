 abstract = {This paper proposes a new method for achieving precise video segmentation without any supervision or interaction. The main contributions of this report include 1) the introduction of fully automatic segmentation based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation of the Markov random field (MRF) with graph cuts and saliency-driven priors and 2) the updating of priors and feature likelihoods by integrating the previous segmentation results and the currently estimated saliency-based visual attention. Test results indicate that our new method precisely extracts probable regions from videos without any supervised interactions.},
